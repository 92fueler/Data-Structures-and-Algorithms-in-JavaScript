//static array vs dynamic array

//static array --> the size is fixed --> you have to specify the size ahead of time 

//dynamic array 
/*
It allows us to copy and rebuild the array at a new location which with more memory 
if we want more memory. 
*/

/*
dynamic array 
lookup 
append 
insert 
delete 
*/

//c++ --> you have to assign memory ahead of time. 
int a[10];
int b[5] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}


/*
In JS and other languages like Python where you have lists and array list in Java
they work like dynamic arrays. They automatically allocate memory according to the increase in size of the array.
