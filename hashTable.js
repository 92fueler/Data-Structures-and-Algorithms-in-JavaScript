//hash table or hash maps or ordered maps or dictionaries 


/*
every language has its built-in hash table just like array
in Python it's called dictionaries, in JS we call objects 
In ruby, it's called hash. 

Where this name comes from? 

Hash tables:
we have a key, and we send it through a hash function that is going to hash something really really fast 
and then map whatever the hash comes out into a memory address where we can store the data 


hash function is a function that generates a value ramdom pattern 
example: md5 hash generator, sha-1 hash generator, sha-256 hash generator

//ES6
//Map Set 

//map can save any types of keys not just strings. It also maintains the order of keys but keys in hash table don't have order. 

//set is very similar to map. the only difference is that set only has keys not values.
