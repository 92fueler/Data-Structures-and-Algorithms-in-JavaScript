//hash table or hash maps or ordered maps or dictionaries 

//hash table is a data structure which organizes data using hash functions in order to support quick insertion and search. 


/*
every language has its built-in hash table just like array,
in Python it's called dictionaries; in JS we call objects; In ruby, it's called hash. 

Where this name comes from? 

Hash tables:
we have a key, and we send it through a hash function that is going to hash something really really fast 
and then map whatever the hash comes out into a memory address where we can store the data 

Hash function:
it maps the key to a specific bucket. 
example: 
we use y = x % 5 as a hash function, where x is the key value and y is the index of the assigned bucket. 
example: md5 hash generator, sha-1 hash generator, sha-256 hash generator

//Map Set 

//map can save any types of keys not just strings. It also maintains the order of keys but keys in hash table don't have order. 

//set is very similar to map. the only difference is that set only has keys not values.
