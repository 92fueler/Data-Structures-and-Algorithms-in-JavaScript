//searching problem

/*
input: a sequence of n numbers A = <a1, a2, ... , an> and a value v. 
output: an index i such that v = A[i] or the special value NIL of v  doesn't appear in A. 

write a program for linear search, which scans through the sequence, looking for v. 
Using a loop invaraint, prove that your algorithm is corrent. Make sure that your loop
invariant fulfills the three necessary properties.
