# Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript 

The purpose of this repository is to help junior developers learn Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript, using Leetcode problems. 

Each Leetcode problem will be tackled with four steps: 
1. clarifying the problem you are solving
2. coming up possible solutions
  * comaring (time and space complexity)
  * choosing the optimal solution
3. coding
4. writing test cases
