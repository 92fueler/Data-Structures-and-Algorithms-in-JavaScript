        <h1>Linked List Construction</h1>
        <p>
            Write a class for a Doubly Linked List. <br>
            The class should have a "head" and "tail" properties, both of which should point to <br>
            either the None(null) value or to a Linked List node. The class should support setting the <br>
            head and tail of the linked list, inserting nodes before and after other nodes as well as <br>
            at certain positions, removing given nodes and removing nodes with specific values, and <br>
            searching for nodes with values. Only the searching method should return a value: specifically, a boolean. <br>
        </p>
