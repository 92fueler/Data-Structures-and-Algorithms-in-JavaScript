//sorting

/*
sorting:
1. insertion sort
2. merger 
solving recurrence 
*/

/*
binary serach: 
A[0:n] --> looking for a specific item 

not obvious sorting problem:
data compression
other sorting problems for example: cocktail sort, bitonic sort 
*/

//insertion sort 

/*
insertion-sort(A, n) 


comparions >> swaps 

binary insertion sort: 
binary search in insertion sort gives you a less time 

*/

//merge sort 
/*
 divide and conquer --> keep spliting 
 
*/
