//object in JavaScript is hash table


/*
hash function 
idempotent 

key-value --> can be any types in JS 
key can be functions, numbers and so on too. 
In JS, it will be strintified to the strings stored in the object.

However, ES6, we have Map and Set 
const a = new Map()
const b = new Sets() 




lookup --> o(1) 
insert --> o(1)
delete --> o(1)
search --> o(1) 

cons:
hash collision 
--> limited space and lots of data --> cannot avoid collision 

two common ways: 
1. linked list 
2.
