//static array vs dynamic array

/*
dynamic array 
lookup 
append 
insert 
delete 
*/

//c++ --> you have to assign memory ahead of time. 
int a[10];
int b[5] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}


/*
In JS and other languages like Python where you have lists and array list in Java
they work like dynamic arrays. They automatically allocate memory according to the increase in size of the array.
