            An example of a circular queue is the Hot Potato game. <br>
            In this game, children are organized in a circle. <br>
            Before the game starts, they determine a number - num, <br>
            and they pass the hot potato to their neighbor <br>
            and the hot potato stops being passed at the num-th child. <br>
            This num-th child will be removed from this game. <br>
            <br>
            This action is repeated until there is only one child left. <br>
            And, that is the winner for this game.

                var queue = new Queue();
                for (var i = 0; i < children.length; i++) {
                    queue.enqueue(children[i]);
                }

                while(queue.size() > 1) {
                    for (var i = 0; i < num; i++) {
                        queue.enqueue(queue.dequeue());
